# niffy
Perceptual diffing suite for [Nightmare](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare), built by [Segment](https://segment.com).

## Getting Started
You can look at [`test/index.js`](https://github.com/segmentio/niffy/blob/master/test/index.js) as an example for how to use Niffy. To run the example test just do `make test` after cloning this repo.

## Reference
Niffy is built on [Nightmare](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare) and used in combination with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). You'll also need to read and use both of those library's APIs to use niffy effectively.

### Niffy(basehost, testhost[, options])
To create a new Niffy differ:

```js
let niffy = new Niffy(basehost, testhost, nightmareOptions);
```

* `basehost` is the url that is assumed "good"
* `testhost` is the url that you are comparing to the base
* `nightmareOptions` can be seen [here in the Nightmare docs](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare#nightmareoptions)

### .test(url[, fn])
This method instructs niffy to go to a `url` (and optionally take additional actions like clicking, typing or checkboxing via the `fn` argument), and test `basehost` vs. `testhost` screenshots for pixel differences, and output the diff-highlight image. Typically you'll use `.test(url, fn)` in the body of a mocha test, like this:

```js
it('/news', function* () {
  yield niffy.test('/news');
});
```

### .goto(url[, fn])
This method instructs niffy to go to a `url` and optionally take additional actions like clicking, typing or checkboxing via the `fn` argument. Typically you'll use `.goto(url, fn)` in the `before` method of a mocha test suite, like this:

```js
before(function* () {
  yield niffy.goto('/logout', function* (nightmare) {
    yield nightmare
      .type('input[name="email"]', 'fake@faketestfaketest.com')
      .type('input[name="password"]', 'fakepassword')
      .click('button[type="submit"]');
  });
});
```

### .end()
This method closes the underlying Nightmare instance (e.g. freeing up memory). Typically you'll use `.end()` in the `after` method of a mocha test suite, like this:

```js
after(function* () {
  yield niffy.end();
});
```
